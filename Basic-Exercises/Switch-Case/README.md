# Menu with Switch-Case in C++

This C++ program demonstrates the use of a `switch-case` statement to create a simple menu with three options. The first option prints a message, the second option performs a sum of two numbers, and the third option exits the program.

## Description

The program consists of the following steps:

1. **Declare an integer variable `opcion`**: This variable will store the user's menu selection.
2. **Prompt the user to choose an option**: The user is presented with three options:
    1. Print a message
    2. Perform a sum
    3. Exit the program
3. **Use a `switch-case` statement to handle the user's selection**:
    - **Case 1**: Prints a friendly message.
    - **Case 2**: Prompts the user to enter two numbers, then calculates and prints their sum.
    - **Case 3**: Prints a message indicating that the program is exiting.
    - **Default case**: Prints a message asking the user to enter a valid option from the list.

This program helps in understanding how to use the `switch-case` statement to create a menu-driven program in C++.
