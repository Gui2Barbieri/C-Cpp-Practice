# 2D Array Iteration in C++

This C++ program demonstrates the use of nested loops to iterate through a 2D array and print its elements. The program initializes a 2D array with predefined values and then prints each element in a formatted manner.

## Description

The program consists of the following steps:

1. **Declare and initialize a 2D array `edades`**:
    - The array has 6 rows and 4 columns, with predefined integer values representing ages.

2. **Use nested `for` loops to iterate through the 2D array**:
    - The outer loop iterates through the rows of the array.
    - The inner loop iterates through the columns of the array.
    - Each element of the array is printed with a space separator.
    - After each row is printed, a newline character is added to format the output.

This program helps in understanding how to use nested loops to iterate through a 2D array and print its elements in a structured format in C++.
