# Sum of User-Entered Numbers in C++

This C++ program demonstrates the use of a `while` loop to allow the user to enter numbers via the console. The program continues to accept numbers until the user enters `0`, at which point it sums all the entered numbers and displays the total.

## Description

The program consists of the following steps:

1. **Declare integer variables `numero` and `suma_num`**:
    - `numero` is used to store the user's input.
    - `suma_num` is initialized to `0` and will store the sum of the entered numbers.

2. **Prompt the user to enter numbers**:
    - The user is instructed to enter a collection of numbers and press `0` when finished.

3. **Use a `while` loop to read user input**:
    - The loop continues as long as the user enters a number that is not `0`.
    - Each entered number is added to `suma_num`.
    - A message is printed indicating the entered number.

4. **Display the total sum**:
    - After the loop ends, the total sum of the entered numbers is printed.

This program helps in understanding how to use a `while` loop to read and process user input, and how to perform arithmetic operations on the input in C++.
