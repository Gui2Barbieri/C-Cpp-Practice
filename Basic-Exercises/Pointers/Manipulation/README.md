# Pointer Manipulation in C++

Various exercises demonstrating the use of pointers in C++ to manipulate the value of a variable by passing its memory address to a function. The programs show how to use pointers to modify the value of a variable and return the updated value, alongside more tests.

## Description

The program consists of a global variable `var` initialized to 10 and a function `funcion` that takes a pointer as a parameter. The function modifies the value at the memory address pointed to by the pointer. The `main` function calls `funcion` and prints the values before and after the function call.

I use constant pointers to constants, pointers to constants, pointer to variables, etc.
