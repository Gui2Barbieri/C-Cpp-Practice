# Random Number Generation in C++

This program demonstrates how to generate random numbers using the `rand` and `srand` functions in C++. It explores the use of a fixed seed and a dynamic seed based on the system time to produce different random numbers each time the program runs.

## Description

The program consists of two main parts:
1. **Fixed Seed Random Number Generation**: This part of the code generates a random number using a fixed seed. However, it is commented out because it produces the same random number every time the program runs.
2. **Dynamic Seed Random Number Generation**: This part of the code generates random numbers using a dynamic seed based on the system time. This ensures that different random numbers are produced each time the program runs.

This program also generates random numbers in a particular range, in this case, between 243 and 1243 for example.
