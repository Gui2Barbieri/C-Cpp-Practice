# Maximum Value Finder

This C program consists of three files and is designed to find the maximum value among three user-input integers. It uses a function defined in a separate module to determine the maximum value.

## Files

1. **modulo01.c**: Contains the main function and handles user input and output.
2. **modulo02.c**: Contains the implementation of the `max` function.
3. **modulo02.h**: Contains the declaration of the `max` function.

## Features

- **Modular Design**: Demonstrates the use of multiple files and header files in a C program.
- **Maximum Value Calculation**: Finds and displays the maximum value among three user-input integers.

## How to Use

1. Compile the program using the following command:
