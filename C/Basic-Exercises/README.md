## Getting Started

To get started with the exercises in this directory, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Gui2Barbieri/C-Cpp-Practice.git
    cd C-Cpp-Practice/C/Basic-Exercises
    ```

2. **Compile the code**:
    Use a C compiler like `gcc` to compile the code files. For example:
    ```bash
    gcc filename.c -o output
    ```

3. **Run the executable**:
    ```bash
    ./output
    ```
