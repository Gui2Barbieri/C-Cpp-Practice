# Menu with Do-While Loop in C++

This C++ program demonstrates the use of a `do-while` loop to create a simple menu with three options. The first two options print a selection message, and the third option exits the program.

## Description

The program consists of the following steps:

1. **Declare an integer variable `opcion`**: This variable will store the user's menu selection.
2. **Use a `do-while` loop to display the menu and process user input**:
    - The menu is displayed with three options:
        1. Option 1
        2. Option 2
        3. Exit
    - The user is prompted to enter their choice.
    - If the user selects option 1 or 2, a message is printed indicating the selected option.
    - The loop continues until the user selects option 3, which exits the program.

This program helps in understanding how to use a `do-while` loop to create a menu-driven program in C++.
