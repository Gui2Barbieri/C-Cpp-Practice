# Vector Input and Output in C++

This C++ program demonstrates the use of vectors to store user input and then print the stored values. The program includes examples of using a `while` loop to read input until a specific condition is met and a `for-each` loop to print the stored values.

## Description

The program consists of the following steps:

1. **Declare a vector `numeros`**: This vector will store the integers entered by the user.
2. **Declare an integer variable `num`**: This variable will store the user's input temporarily.
3. **Prompt the user to enter numbers**: The user is instructed to enter numbers and exit by entering `0`.
4. **Use a `while` loop to read user input**:
    - The loop continues as long as the user enters a number that is not `0`.
    - Each entered number is added to the vector using the `push_back` method.
5. **Use a `for-each` loop to print the stored values**:
    - The loop iterates through the vector and prints each stored number with a message.

This program helps in understanding how to use vectors, `while` loops, and `for-each` loops in C++ to read and process user input.
