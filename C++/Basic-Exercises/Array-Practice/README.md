# Vehicle Count Detector

This C++ program simulates a vehicle count detector that records the number of vehicles passing by at different times. It uses a 4D array to store the vehicle counts for each hour, day, month, and year within a specified range.

## Features

- **4D Array**: Uses a 4D array to store vehicle counts for each hour, day, month, and year.
- **Random Vehicle Counts**: Generates random vehicle counts for simulation purposes.
- **User Input**: Prompts the user to input the day, month, year, and hour to retrieve the vehicle count for that specific time.

## How to Use

1. Run the program.
2. Enter the day, month, year (from 2000 to 2007), and hour when prompted.
3. The program will display the vehicle count for the specified time.
