# Vector-Practice

## Description

In this repo you will find some tests I did with vectors, such as asking the user to put the number of positions, fill them, then search thorough it using loops.
Also, some concepts like .erase(), .pushback(), .begin(), .size(), etc are implemented.

Linux executables are included.
