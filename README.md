# C-Cpp-Practice

Welcome to my C and C++ practice repository! This repo contains my experiments and exercises as I learn and improve my skills in C and C++ programming.

## Repository Structure

- **C++**: Contains various C++ practice files and projects.
- **C**: Contains various C practice files and projects.

## About

This repository is a collection of my practice and experiments with C and C++. It includes different types of programs and exercises that I have worked on to enhance my understanding and proficiency in these languages.
Note that mostly executables are Linux builds, also there may be some exercise which only have the source-code without any compilation done.

Some interesting exercises that I liked are:

### Floating Flooring (C++)
    - This exercise involves creating a program to simulate the installation of floating flooring.
    - It covers concepts such as arrays, loops, and conditional statements to manage the layout and fitting of the flooring pieces.

### Prime Number (C++)
    - This exercise focuses on developing a program to check if a number is prime.
    - It includes the implementation of efficient algorithms to determine prime numbers and explores optimization techniques.

### Random Number Guess Game (C++)
    - This exercise is about building a simple game where the user has to guess a randomly generated number.
    - It involves using loops, conditional statements, and random number generation to create an interactive and engaging experience.

### ASCII-Printer (C)
    - A program to print ASCII characters.
    - Demonstrates the use of loops and character handling.

### Arithmetic-Sequence (C)
    - A program to generate or work with arithmetic sequences.
    - Includes examples of loops and arithmetic operations.

### Bishop-Chess (C)
    - A program related to chess moves, specifically for the bishop piece.
    - Demonstrates the use of arrays and conditional statements.

### Discount-Calculator (C)
    - A program to calculate discounts.
    - Includes examples of user input and arithmetic operations.

### Fibonacci Series (C)
    - Multiple versions, including input validation and improved algorithms.
    - Demonstrates the use of loops, recursion, and input validation.

## Leap-Year (C)
    - A program to determine if a year is a leap year.
    - Includes examples of conditional statements and user input.

## How to Use

Feel free to browse through the folders and files. Each file is a standalone program or exercise. You can clone the repository and run the programs on your local machine.
